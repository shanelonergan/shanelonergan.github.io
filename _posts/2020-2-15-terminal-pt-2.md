**note** I use macOS, so this series will be written for macOS users. Most should work on any unix-based operating systems, but I will not have tested it.

## Frameworks

Shell frameworks are essentially a bundle of aliases, functions, defaults, themes, and plugins and plugin manager. They can vary in size and complexity, and can dramatically increase the functionality of your shell.

### Oh My Zsh

The standard terminal that ships with MacOS it quite good. It can likely handle anything you would need to use it for, and it is easy to use. However, it is not as customizable or performant as some other options, which is why many people like to download a third-party emulator.
