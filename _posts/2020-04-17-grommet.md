There are many great ways to style your React applications, from classic CSS/SASS stylesheets, CSS-in-JS(such as styled components), and CSS libraries such as Tailwind or Bulma. There are also UI libraries, which provide pre-styled components for you to build your application with. Material UI, React Bootstrap, and Semantic UI are among the most popular, but lately I have really enjoyed using Grommet. Grommet is a wide library of components which brags some big name users such as Netflix and Boeing. Grommet has great theme tooling and makes specializes in accessible, mobile-friendly applications.
