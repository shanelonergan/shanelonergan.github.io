There are many great ways to style your React applications, from classic CSS/SASS stylesheets, CSS-in-JS(such as styled components), and CSS libraries such as Tailwind or Bulma. There are also UI libraries, which provide pre-styled components for you to build your application with. Material UI, React Bootstrap, and Semantic UI are among the most popular, but lately I have really enjoyed using Grommet. Grommet is a wide library of components which brags some big name users such as Netflix and Boeing. Grommet has great theme tooling and specializes in accessible, mobile-friendly applications. In this article I will walk though building a new react app using Grommet!

## Setting up

### Create-React-App

This tutorial will be utilizing Create-React-App(CRA). Instructions for getting started with CRA can be found [here](). We will also be using npm as our package manager, but feel free to use the package manager of your choice.

```bash
create-react-app grommet-tutorial
cd grommet-tutorial
rm -rf yarn.lock
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### Clean Up

Next, for the purposes of this tutorial, we will clean up some of the unnecessary files. From the 'src' directory, remove the following files:

- src/App.css
- src/App.test.js
- src/index.css
- src/logo.svg

You can copy and paste the following command to delete them all at once:

```bash
# working directory: grommet-tutorial
rm -rf src/App.css && rm -rf src/App.test.js && rm -rf src/index.css && rm -rf src/logo.svg
```

Inside `src/index.js`, remove the import of `index.css`. Inside `src/App.js`, remove the import of the logo and `App.css`.

### Add Grommet

Next, we are going to add grommet and the accompanying icons pack to our project:

```bash
npm install grommet grommet-icons --save
```

Now we will import Grommet at the top of `App.js` like so:

```javascript react
import { Grommet } from 'grommet';
```

Your `App.js` file should now look like this:

```javascript react
import React from 'react';
import { Grommet } from 'grommet';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
