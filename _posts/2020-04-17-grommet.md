There are many great ways to style your React applications, from classic CSS/SASS stylesheets, CSS-in-JS(such as styled components), and CSS libraries such as Tailwind or Bulma. There are also UI libraries, which provide pre-styled components for you to build your application with. Material UI, React Bootstrap, and Semantic UI are among the most popular, but lately I have really enjoyed using Grommet. Grommet is a wide library of components which brags some big name users such as Netflix and Boeing. Grommet has great theme tooling and specializes in accessible, mobile-friendly applications. In this article I will walk though building a new react app using Grommet!

## Setting up

### Create-React-App

This tutorial will be utilizing Create-React-App(CRA). Instructions for getting started with CRA can be found [here](). We will also be using npm as our package manager, but feel free to use the package manager of your choice.

```bash
create-react-app grommet-tutorial
cd grommet-tutorial
rm -rf yarn.lock
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### Clean Up

Next, for the purposes of this tutorial, we will clean up some of the unnecessary files. From the 'src' directory, remove the following files:

-   src/App.css
-   src/App.test.js
-   src/index.css
-   src/logo.svg

You can copy and paste the following command to delete them all at once:

```bash
# working directory: grommet-tutorial
rm -rf src/App.css && rm -rf src/App.test.js && rm -rf src/index.css && rm -rf src/logo.svg
```

Inside `src/index.js`, remove the import of `index.css`. Inside `src/App.js`, remove the import of the logo and `App.css`. Don't forget to delete the `<img>` tag containing the logo as well.

### Add Grommet

Next, we are going to add grommet and the accompanying icons pack to our project:

```bash
npm install grommet grommet-icons --save
```

Now we will import Grommet at the top of `App.js` like so:

```javascript react
import { Grommet } from 'grommet'
```

Your `App.js` file should now look like this:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { Grommet } from 'grommet'

function App() {
	return (
		<div className='App'>
			<header className='App-header'>
				<p>
					Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
				</p>
				<a className='App-link' href='https://reactjs.org' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>
					Learn React
				</a>
			</header>
		</div>
	)
}

export default App
```

## Adding Components

The first thing we need to do to start using Grommet is to wrap the entire app in the `Grommet` component we imported at the end of the last step. Once we do, we can utilize any of the grommet components inside. To do this, lets replace the main app div with `Grommet`:

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <Grommet>

      // ...

    </Grommet>
  )
```

Next, lets import a couple themes for us to use! Grommet comes with a few out of the box, but you can also create your own custom themes. Go ahead and import the standard light and dark themes, and add one to your `Grommet` component:

```js
import { grommet, dark } from 'grommet/themes'

// ...

function App() {
    return (
        <Grommet theme={dark}>
            // ...
        </Grommet>
    )
}
```

If you are using `dark`, you may notice that it doesn't extend to the edges of the screen. To fix this, lets add the prop `full` to `Grommet`, like so:

```js

function App() {
    return (
        <Grommet theme={dark} full>
            // ...
        </Grommet>
    )
}
```

Viola! Modifying components is as simple as passing in props. We dive into this more in a bit.

The next component we will use is called `Box`, and it is essentially a div with benefits. `Box` has Flexbox built in, and comes default as a flex column. Let's go ahead and replace the `<header>` tag with a `Box`. With any new component, we will need to import it before we can use it:

```js
import { Grommet, Box } from 'grommet'

// ...

function App() {
    return (
        <Grommet theme={grommet}>
            <Box>
                <p>
                Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
                </p>
                <a className='App-link' href='https://reactjs.org' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>
                    Learn React
                </a>
            </Box>
        </Grommet>
    )
}
```

You shouldn't see a big change yet, so lets modify the box a little bit to make things look better. In order to modify a component, all we need to do is pass in values as props! Lets say we want to center all of our text
