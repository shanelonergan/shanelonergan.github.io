Scroll animations are one of my favorite features to add to a website. They are a feature that, while relatively simple to add, can make your website feel much more slick and interactive. In this blog post, I am going to walk through adding scroll animations to a React application using the [AOS](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) library.

## Install AOS

The first step is to install AOS in you app using your preferred package manager. For the purposes of this post, we will be using npm. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
npm install --save aos@nex
```
