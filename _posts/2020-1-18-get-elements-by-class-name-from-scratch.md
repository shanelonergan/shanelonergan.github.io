I am currently diving into my first job search as a software engineer, and so I recently had a mock technical interview. The interview was done in Javascript, and consisted of two questions. The first was a fairly standard algorithm question, but the second was quite interesting. I was asked to build the `Document.getElementByClassName` method from scratch, as if it didn't exist. I found it enlightening to build out a method that I had used so many times before, and improved my understanding of both DOM manipulation and Javascript as a whole. In this article I will walk you through the solution I came up with.
