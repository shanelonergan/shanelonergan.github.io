Welcome back to Finding The Perfect Terminal! If you haven't yet read part one, you can find it [here](https://shanelonergan.github.io/terminal-pt-1/). In part two I will go over supercharging your workflow with shell frameworks, and making it look as good as it feels with themes and plugins.

**note** I use macOS, so this series will be written for macOS users. Most should work on any unix-based operating systems, but I will not have tested it.
