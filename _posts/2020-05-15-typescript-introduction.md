I am in the midst of searching for my first job as a developer. Recently, I had the the opportunity to interview for a company I thought I would be a great fit for. It was a junior position with a stack that I was mostly familiar with, and in a sector that I had prior work experience in. However, the job description said that most of the code is written in TypeScript. Now, I have heard a lot about TypeScript from other developers, but I hadn't had the chance to start learning it yet. I figured this was the perfect chance to take the plunge! I had an open weekend before the interview, so I decided to see how much I could learn! In this post I will walk you through the basics of TypeScript, as well as the benefits it offers over JavaScript. The goal is to learn enough to be conversational, as well as to give a strong jumping off point if you were to start learning it on the job.
