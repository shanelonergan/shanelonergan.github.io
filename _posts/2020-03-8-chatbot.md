IBM Watson is a powerful artificial intelligence platform. Luckily, IBM is very developer friendly, and offers some outstanding APIs which let devs take advantage of Watson's power. I had been interested in using one of these APIs for a while when I discovered their Toxic Comment Classifier. This is a machine learning model that utilizes natural language processing analyze a piece of text and detect six different types of toxic language. I spend a lot of time on the internet, so I could see many ways in which this model might be useful. I had recently been toying with the idea of making a Slackbot, so I decided to combine the two and make a Slackbot that detects and responds to toxic messages. In this article I will walk through my experience building the Toxic Comment Bot!
