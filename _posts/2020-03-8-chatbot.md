IBM Watson is a powerful artificial intelligence platform. Luckily, IBM is very developer friendly, and offers some outstanding APIs which let devs take advantage of Watson's power. I had been interested in using one of these APIs for a while when I discovered their Toxic Comment Classifier. This is a machine learning model that utilizes natural language processing analyze a piece of text and detect six different types of toxic language. I spend a lot of time on the internet, so I could see many ways in which this model might be useful. I had recently been toying with the idea of making a Slackbot, so I decided to combine the two and make a Slackbot that detects and responds to toxic messages. In this article I will walk through my experience building the Toxic Comment Bot!

# Part 1: Building the SlackBot

The first thing we want to do is build a skeleton of the bot which we can later add the Watson API to. In order to do this we will use Node.js and an NPM package called SlackBots.js. We will be making requests to an external API from our Node file, so we will want to install axios as well. Create a new folder with an index.js folder, and make sure you have all three packages installed with before moving on. Be sure to run `npm init` as well, and answer all the prompts that follow. We are also going to be handling API keys, so feel free to configure your preferred environmental variable setup. If you haven't done this before, I recommend [Dotenv](link). [Here](link) is an article explaining why hiding your API keys is essential. Once this is done, we are ready to get coding.

Next we need to take care of our Slack setup. We will need a workspace for the bot to exist in. If you don't have one in mind, you can [make a new one](https://slack.com/help/articles/206845317-Create-a-Slack-workspace). Next we are going to register our Slack bot. The first step is to create a new app, which you can do [here](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1). Enter the name of the app, and the workspace it will live in. Next go to settings > Basic Information and click on `Add features and Functionality`

## Step 1: configure dependancies

In our index.js file, we want to add our dependancies like so:

```js
require('dotenv').config()
const SlackBot = require('slackbots');
const axios = require('axios')
```

## Step 2: Initialize SlackBot

Now we want to create a new Slackbot instance, which we need to provide a name and out API key.
