Welcome back to **What Even Is?**, the series where I break down common programming concepts I keep encountering but never fully understand, until now! Today we will be looking at one of the most commonly thrown around terms in programming: *API*.If you are anything like me, than API is an easy word to use in a sentence, yet hard to actually define. I have built many Web APIs myself, but I realized I still didn't fully grasp the concept. In this article, I will guide you through what I learned as I attempted to break down and API to its simplest form.
