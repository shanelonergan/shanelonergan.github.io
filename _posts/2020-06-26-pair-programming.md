Pair programming is an essential skill for any developer who works on a team. It is a great way to improve your code quality, learn from each other, and get started in more complex projects and codebases. If you have never paired before, it usually consists of two developers working together on one task. Typically there are two roles, a driver and a navigator. The driver sits at the keyboard and physically types the code, while the navigator provides the instructions for what the driver should be doing. Each person takes turns fulfilling each role. In this post, i will walk you through some tips I have discovered that lead to more productive, happier pairing sessions. Lets dive in!

## Tip #1: Set up the parameters of the session before beginning

In order to start off your pairing session on the right food, it is essential to first set some ground rules. Have a conversation with your partner about your previous pairing experience, and just get to know each other a little bit. Here are some great topics to go over:

- How long will the session be going for?
- How long of intervals do you want to work before swapping roles?
- Do you want to take breaks? How long? How often?
- Who will be the first driver?
- What is something that bothers you in a pairing session?
- What is something you really enjoy in a pairings session?
- How do you like to give and receive feedback?

## Tip #2: Set Goals

It is helpful to set some concrete goals of what you want to accomplish during the session. Write down your goals somewhere you both can see them, and asses your progress each time you switch roles.

## Tip #3: Be an empathetic navigator, but don't be an island

As the navigator, it is your job to explicitly instruct the driver what to do. However, make sure your partner is following you!

## Tip #4: Be a dutiful navigator, but make sure you understand

## Tip #5: Ask for feedback
