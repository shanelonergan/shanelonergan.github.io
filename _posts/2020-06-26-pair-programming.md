Pair programming is an essential skill for any developer who works on a team. It is a great way to improve your code quality, learn from each other, and build your understanding of complex code. If you have never paired before, it usually consists of two developers working together on one task. Typically there are two roles, a driver and a navigator. The driver sits at the keyboard and physically types the code, while the navigator provides the instructions for what the driver should be doing. Each person takes turns fulfilling each role. In this post, i will walk you through some tips I have discovered that lead to more productive, happier pairing sessions. Lets dive in!
