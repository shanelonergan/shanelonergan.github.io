Pair programming is an essential skill for any developer who works on a team. It is a great way to improve your code quality, learn from each other, and get started in more complex projects and codebases. If you have never paired before, it usually consists of two developers working together on one task. Typically there are two roles, a driver and a navigator. The driver sits at the keyboard and physically types the code, while the navigator provides the instructions for what the driver should be doing. Each person takes turns fulfilling each role. In this post, i will walk you through some tips I have discovered that lead to more productive, happier pairing sessions. Lets dive in!

## Tip #1: Set up the parameters of the session before beginning

In order to start off your pairing session on the right food, it is essential to first set some ground rules. Have a conversation with your partner about your previous pairing experience, and just get to know each other a little bit. Here are some great topics to go over:

- How long will the session be going for?
- How long of intervals do you want to work before swapping roles?
- Do you want to take breaks? How long? How often?
- Who will be the first driver?
- What is something that bothers you in a pairing session?
- What is something you really enjoy in a pairings session?
- How do you like to give and receive feedback?

## Tip #2: Set Goals

It is helpful to set some concrete goals of what you want to accomplish during the session. Write down your goals somewhere you both can see them, and asses your progress each time you switch roles.

## Tip #3: Be an empathetic navigator, but don't be an island

As the navigator, it is your job to explicitly instruct the driver what to do. However, make sure your partner is following you! Check in with them every to often to make sure they understand the code that is being written. This is a great opportunity for growth, so if you are navigating and are more experienced, help the driver understand the decisions you are making. If you are the navigation but are less experienced than the driver, don't be afraid to ask for help. Just because you are in control, doesn't mean you can't ask for suggestions. Ultimately, pair programming is meant to be collaborative, so keep an open mind and don't be afraid to make mistakes.

## Tip #4: Be a dutiful driver, but make sure you understand

As the driver, it is your job to follow the navigators instructions. If you are the more experienced programmer, make sure you give the driver space to work out their thoughts. If you think that they are making a mistake, or that you know a better way, perhaps wait a moment before immediately giving your thoughts. Let the driver make a mistake and correct it themselves! Or, perhaps wait until you reach a pause or an end of a block of code, and then offer your suggestion. There is a fine line to walk between being helpful and bulldozing over the navigator's ideas. If you are the less experienced programmer, make sure you understand what you are typing! Don't be afraid to speak up and ask questions. It is a good idea to check in at the end of each code block and go through each line together if needed. Driving for an experienced navigator is a great way to learn!

## Tip #5: Ask for feedback
