The terminal is usually one of the first things that a new programmer learns how to use. Also referred to as the command line, or Command Line Interface (CLI), it is our way of speaking directly to the computer. What is often referred to as the terminal is a terminal emulator. This is a program that opens a window and allows us to interact with the shell. The shell is a program that takes input from the user in the form of text and hands it to the operating system to perform.

If you are anything like me, it didn't take a long time before you started customizing your terminal. Luckily, there are tons of ways to tailor your terminal to perfectly match your workflow and aesthetic preferences. In this guide, I will walk through some of the different emulators and shells I have worked with, and take a look into which could be right for you.

**note** I use macOS, so this series will be written for macOS users. Most should work on any unix-based operating systems, but I will not have tested it.
