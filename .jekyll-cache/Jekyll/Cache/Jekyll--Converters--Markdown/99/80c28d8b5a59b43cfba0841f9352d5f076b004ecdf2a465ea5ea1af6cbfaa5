<p>This guide assumes some basic Ruby, HTML/CSS, and git experience. It will still be possible to follow without, but it may require a bit of extra research. Start by following the instructions under Set Up Your Environment. If you get stuck, I have added some articles that I found helpful in the further reading below.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Custom bash commands are keywords that you can explicitly define to either execute a new function or shorten an existing command. These commands are extremely versatile and customizable, allowing you to tailor them to increase your productivity. Once they are defined in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.bash_profile</code> document, you will be able to call on them in any new terminal session.</p>

<p>Creating your personal website can often be a daunting task. There are a ton of options for a variety of skill levels, from using Wix or Wordpress templates to coding one from scratch. Building from scratch gives you the most control over the end product, while using a template can get you up and running quickly with the lowest learning curve. If you have a little bit of coding experience, something in the middle might actually be the best option. One way to create a simple, beautiful websites quickly is to use Jekyll, and then deploy it for free on GitHub Pages. Jekyll is a ruby gem which is great for creating personal websites and blogs, and is what I used to make my own blogging site. It offers a variety of themes, is extremely customizable, and most importantly, it is fast! Creating and deploying your own personal website using Jekyll can be done in less than an hour.</p>

<h3 id="set-up-your-environment-optional">Set up your environment (optional)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Download a text editor if you donâ€™t already have one. I use Atom, but a lot of people really love Visual Studio Code as well.</li>
  <li>Create a GitHub account. Git is a version control sofware</li>
  <li>Install Homebrew
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Install Ruby and Bundler
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ brew install ruby
$ gem install bundler
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Jekyll is a Ruby gem, which is essentially a library of code created by a group of dedicated programmers and released, for free, to us. It is open source, which means that is it maintained by more amazing programmers who volunteer their time to keep great software free and accessible.</p>

<p>Getting started with Jekyll is super simple. Just enter the following commands in your terminal:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~ $ cd ..

~ $ mkdir jekyll-projects

~ $ cd jekyll-projects

~ $ gem install bundler jekyll

~ $ jekyll new my-awesome-site

~ $ cd my-awesome-site

~ $ bundle exec jekyll serve
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, open up your web browser and go to http://localhost:4000. TaDa! You have a website up and running! Take a browse through this website to familiarize yourself with the basic Jekyll theme.</p>

<h3 id="make-a-custom-jekyll-project">Make a custom Jekyll project</h3>

<p>Now that you have created your first Jekyll site, you will want to take a look at the themes and decide which one you want to use for your own. You can find all of the themes available at jekyllthemes.io. There is a wide variety of beautiful free and paid themes designed for blogs, portfolios, landing pages, and more. Once you have decided on your theme, it is time to dive in.</p>

<h1 id="step-1-open-the-theme-on-your-local-computer">Step 1: Open the theme on your local computer</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate the the GitHub page for the theme of your choice (there should be a link in the description).
IMAGE</li>
  <li>Fork the repository
IMAGE</li>
  <li>Clone the repo into your local folder
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~ $ git clone "https://github.com/shanelonergan/flexible-jekyll.git"
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Navigate into the project folder
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~ $ cd flexible-jekyll-theme
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Open it in your editor
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>atom .
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Run your server
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>jekyll serve
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>Now you can browse your template on http://localhost:4000.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="step-2-customize-the-project-with-your-own-information">Step 2: Customize the project with your own information</h1>

<p>In your project directory, you should see a file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>. Click on that file to open it, and you will see a document with all of the stock information in it. You can replace this placeholder text with all of your personal information, and it will show up on your web page. If you want to add any images, drag and drop them into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">img</code> folder. Then just provide the file name in the config file, and you are good to go!</p>

<h1 id="step-3-add-your-content">Step 3: Add your content</h1>

<p>If you are creating a personal blog, there should be a couple sample posts. To create a new post, create a new file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> folder. You will have to write your posts in markdown, which might be new. However, donâ€™t despair! Markdown is actually a fantastic and simple way to create great looking text files. Copy and paste the header from one of the sample posts, and update it with your postâ€™s info. Now all that is left is the the easy part: write your post!</p>

<h3 id="host-your-website-on-github-pages">Host your website on GitHub Pages</h3>

<p>So, you have finished writing your posts and adding all of your content, and your website looks fantastic in your local browser. Congratulations! That is no small feat. Now it is time to get it up and running for the world to see. Normally hosting your website can be a little bit of a complicated process, but GitHub makes it super easy.</p>
